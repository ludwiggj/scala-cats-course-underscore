    // At this point we know we have associativity and identity â€” in other words we have a Category.
    // In our Category the objects are Scala types and the arrows are A -> (B, String)
    // (instead of simple A -> B arrows). The fact that the arrows are not simple transformation
    // from A -> B makes them so called Kleisli arrows. Kleisli arrows can work with many different
    // types, not only a tuple of some type B and String, they are defined for the types we impose
    // as few conditions as possible, in other words for monadic types. This is where Cats
    // definition of Kleisli comes in.

    // Kleisli enables composition of functions that return a monadic value, for instance an
    // Option[Int] or a Either[String, List[Double]], without having functions take an Option or
    // Either as a parameter, which can be strange and unwieldy.
